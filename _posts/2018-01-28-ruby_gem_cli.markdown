Starting my ruby gem cli project tonight. This is very exciting. The first thing im going to do is search for some cool ideas. I want to do something special or at least something cool. Some initial ideas are a Kids Eat Free Gem that scrapes the web for restaurants that are having a kids eat free night on that particular night, A movie rater gem that scrapes the web for popular ratings and returns an avg rating of a particular movie, some type of facial recognition scraper that would take in a photo and return any profiles with that face ( OpenCV Ruby gem for automatic face detection). I really like this last one so i think i will go ahead and make this decision for beginning my project.
