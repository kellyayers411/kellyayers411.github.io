After A FREAKING LOT of research I have decided on the funtionality of my gem. I googled some gem ideas and was immediatly interested in working with the ruby gem opencv which is an image processing gem. I had never worked with any type of hands on image processing only the theory in a couple courses at FSU like computational EE and systems and signals etc. All of that work was very abstract theory and equation solving. Honestly although i could solve those convolution and diffeq problems with the best of them I never quite understood exactly why I was doing it and well we've all had that professor that can't quite explain either so I am so happy right now because I finially understand sooo much more than I ever did. I actually found a course on youtube here: https://youtu.be/jKtQxvzp1A0 in which opencv is taught in phython. This professor is so naturally talented at explaining image processing I emailed him personally to thank him for his course. That link is to the first session of 4 if you are interested at all in image processing this is definitely worth your time. I watched them more than once actually. Anyways so in the course he takes you through a but of different opencv functions and explains input parameters and syntax and return values and more importantly why you would need to use the function. So now I am armed with enough knowledge to do some damage I have been thinking about how I can use it to make my gem awesome. I was thinking originally about using it to do some facial recognition like using the webcam to detect the users face and return if they have a profile on the learn web page that is never changed. We scape that website in one of the scraping labs so it would be perfect with all those profile pictures. The only problem with that is I don't know who will be testing my program and if that person will have a profile picture on that website since afterall it isn't every single learn person ever AND I don't even have a profile on that webiste anymore.
