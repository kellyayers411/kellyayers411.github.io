After A FREAKING LOT of research I have decided on the funtionality of my gem. I googled some gem ideas and was immediatly interested in working with the ruby gem opencv which is an image processing gem. I had never worked with any type of hands on image processing only the theory in a couple courses at FSU like computational EE and systems and signals etc. All of that work was very abstract theory and equation solving. Honestly although i could solve those convolution and diffeq problems with the best of them I never quite understood exactly why I was doing it and well we've all had that professor that can't quite explain either so I am so happy right now because I finially understand sooo much more than I ever did. I actually found a course on youtube here: https://youtu.be/jKtQxvzp1A0 in which opencv is taught in phython. This professor is so naturally talented at explaining image processing I emailed him personally to thank him for his course. That link is to the first session of 4 if you are interested at all in image processing this is definitely worth your time. I watched them more than once actually. Anyways so in the course he takes you through a but of different opencv functions and explains input parameters and syntax and return values and more importantly why you would need to use the function. So now I am armed with enough knowledge to do some damage I have been thinking about how I can use it to make my gem awesome.  So I toyed with several ideas from easy (finish my gem project tonight) to advanced (don't when I will finish) levels. One idea that i particularly found amusing was my AviFy gem idea. It's based on the level of Avi's awesomeness and the fact that all of us coders wish to emulate him. I could take a user chosen profile image from the learn website  and if a face is found image blend it with an Avi image :p I actually did this with my own image with the opencv gem and it worked quite well. But of course while it's funny it's kinda useless and not all that impressive and since i had keep learning not just be stuck on the gem project I've decided to do something more advanced and just work on it for a set number of hours a day and keep learning on learn co the rest of the day. So the final idea I've decided on is to take in a Haar Casscade(an array of facial images) from the webcam of the person using my program and use that to train my own face recognizer in opencv. Then I'm going to scrape the learn website and return the profile of the person using the program. yeah i know awesome. I figure ill be done sometime next year :p
